# 2022_stage17_glia

**These scripts were used to process the raw RNA-seq data and extract neuronal and glial clusters from the embryonic dataset**

Explanation of scripts in this repository, and relationship to https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.502305v1 :

1. "220726 stage 17 glia analysis FINAL.rmd" - We performed scRNA-seq on whole stage 17 embryos (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE208324). We identified glial and neuronal clusters, and subset them from all embryonic cells. We then subsetted repo+ glial cells and eliminated neuronal contamination. This is the first iteration of the embryonic glia data, in which a mito cutoff of <20% was used. Related to Figures 3 + 4.

2. "220726 stage 17 glia part 2 (mitochondrial cleanup).rmd" - We passed the stage 17 glia object (sarah_inc_PCs_clusters3_sub_v3_glia) through a more stringent filtering cutoff of <10% mitochondrial reads and reclustered the cells, resulting in the cleaned stage 17 glial object (embryo_glia_10mito_050522.rds) linked in the "stage 17 glia raw directory.rtf" contained in this repository. Related to Figures 3 + 4.

3. "220726 part 3 neurons + glia mito cleanup.rmd" - We re-processed all stage 17 neuronal + glial cells using <10% mito cutoff, resulting in the final neurons + glia object (embryo_neuronsglia_10percent_jun16.rds) linked in the "stage 17 glia raw directory.rtf" contained in this repository. Related to Figures 3 + 4.

4. "220706_gliapaper_supp_fig_1.rmd" - Code for the analysis of potential batch effects shown in "Supplementary file 3"

5. "stage 17 glia raw directory.rtf" - Provides links to final .RDS objects generated by scripts 1-3 above, in addition to CellRanger outputs derived from our raw data (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE208324)

6. All embryonic data shown here was passed along for further processing and integration with other time points, as documented at https://github.com/VilFernandesLab/2022_DrosophilaGlialAtlas
